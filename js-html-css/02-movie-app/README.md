# 🖋️ ASYNC AWAIT

## 🧠 Points To Remember :
1. "Async" tells a program that it can do something else while waiting for a task to complete.
2. Inside an async function, use the await keyword before a task (like fetching data from a server or reading a file). This tells the program to pause and wait for that task to complete, but it doesn't freeze the whole program.

```

async function name(param0) {
  statements
}
async function name(param0, param1) {
  statements
}

```
